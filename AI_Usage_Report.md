# AI Usage Report

## AI Tools Used
**Primary tools**: ChatGPT (OpenAI), GitHub Copilot  

**Key use cases**:
- Generating boilerplate React components and hooks  
- Writing optimized JavaScript/React code for state management and routing  
- Assisting with Tailwind CSS classes for responsive UI design  
- Debugging runtime errors and suggesting performance improvements  
- Providing explanations for React lifecycle and conditional rendering logic

## Sample Prompts (2-3 examples)
1. “Create a responsive React dashboard component with Tailwind CSS and a dark mode toggle.”  
2. “Help me implement smooth scroll animations using Framer Motion in a Next.js project.”  
3. “Suggest optimized code for API data fetching with error handling in React.”

## AI vs Manual Work Split
- **AI-generated (60%)**: Core structure of React components, reusable hooks, Tailwind utility classes, and API fetch logic.  
- **Manual coding (30%)**: Custom state management, logic for user interactions, and integration of specific project features (e.g., routing, authentication).  
- **Customization (10%)**: Adjusted AI-generated code to match project requirements, added accessibility improvements, optimized performance, and refined design consistency.

This workflow allowed me to **speed up development by reducing repetitive coding**, while still ensuring that **final implementation matched real-world project needs** through manual customization and testing.
